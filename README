To build: 
---------
cd src
./configure
make 
make doc (optional)
cd clients/legacyWatcher
qmake-qt4   (or just qmake if only qt4 is installed on your machine)
make

Look in ./src/doc for User's Guide and ./doc for doxygen generated dev docs.
Look in ./src/watcherd for the watcher daemon and ./src/clients/legacyWatcher 
for the watcher GUI (or one of them anyway).
