Demo/Checkpoints
1. Basic new network transport demo - 3rd/4th week in April
- Run existing test node daemons and new network shim daemon
- Run barebones watcherd that only supports 'real time' streams
- Run messageStream2Text, which dumps test nodes' message streams to
console
- Shows: messages from test nodes demultiplexed through new watcherd to
a "GUI" client. 

2. Network transport transition layer (don't depend on hierarchy for transport) - mid/late May
- Don't run hierarchy daemon. :) 
- Run test node daemons updated to use new network API: gpsDaemon, route daemon, and maybe the WHD if ARL wants it.  
- Run watcherd instance
- Run GE GUI (if available), legacyWatcher (using new network API), or just the text-based "GUI" log dumper program, messageStream2Text.

3. Basic Google Earth Watcher GUI demo - early/Mid June
- Run test node daemons
- Run watcherd
- Run Google Earth w/watcher plugin. 
- Shows: Basic watcher functionality in Google Earth: node location,
node connectivity, labels, layers

4. Refined Google Earth Demo - end of June
- As "Basic Google Earth" demo above.
- Shows: Refinements to basic Google Earth implementation based on
feedback from ARL, Cobham (nee SPARTA). 

5. Full TiVO mode/playback functionality -- as completed (sometime in
June?) - Maybe have concurrent demo at same time as refined Google Earth
demo (#3 above)
- Run test node daemons
- Run watcherd
- Run legacy watcher (with rewind control added to GUI)
- Show live pause, rewind, fast-forward (to current time)
- Stop test node daemons, watcherd, legacy watcher. 
- Start recorded playback using watcherd
- Show pause, rewind, fast-forward, etc in legacy watcher
- TiVO mode demo shows full watcherd functionality including playback
via packet capture database 

6. TBD, end of July (or mid August), last
checkpoint/demo. 
- Shows: choose from list:
- still more refined Google Earth
- first cut of game-engine based watcher GUI
- other GUI implementation?
- specific functionality needed by ARL from SOW or other, TBD.

7. Documentation checkpoint - end of July - 
- Shows: "User documentation and design
documentation to enable ARL to use and extend this software as needed
(contractor format ...)".
