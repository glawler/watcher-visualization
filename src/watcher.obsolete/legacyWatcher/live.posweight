# ip address (or index in simulator) position weight
#
# where position is one of root, neighborhood, regional, or rootgroup,
# and weight is one of assigned, banned, or base 10 non-negative integer.
#
# Higher weight is "preferred".
#   0 == banned < 2147483647(default) < assigned == 0xFFFFFFFF
# So if you want a weight that is preferred over the default, use something
# greater than 2147483647.
