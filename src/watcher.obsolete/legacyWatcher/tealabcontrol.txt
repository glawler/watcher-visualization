How to run the test4 mobility model:  (with tealabcontrol, and company)

This is how I run it...  which assumes all the commands are executed on coke.
All the various script files are in ~tjohnson/idmanet/idsCommunications,
as is the mobility model (.../idsCommunications/test4/).


first: use the test4 mob set.  
	mobpickset control test4
The node IP and MAC addresses are specifically referred to in the test4 
scenario; using other machines is non-trivial.

Run liveinterim2 and company (the demodetectors and hslsd).
	./runcoke test4/test4.conf 3000
	Hit ^C when it says "Running"
The runcoke script just runs all the demons, and redirects the stdout and
stderr as appropriate.  Everyone seems to have their own version of that...
So I tested with mine, but yours should work.

Run the watcher, in the test4 directory.  (watcher must have the locations 
files in its cwd.)
	cd test4
	watcher test4.conf

Watcher should now display the first topology, but the connectivity may
not be correct since tealab isn't running yet.  Assuming tealab was killed
properly, all the nodes should see all the nodes.

Run Tealab
	./runtealab test4/tealab.tdf

When tealab starts, there will be a flash of all nodes seeing all nodes,
followed by all nodes going to floating root.

Run tealabcontrol
	tealabcontrol

tealabcontrol will then stop or start the mobility every time you hit return.
There is no way to rewind.  (That would require major work on tealab.)

To restart the hierarchy stuff:
	./runcoke test4/test4.conf 3000   
	(runcoke kills all the already existing stuff, and reruns it, 
	independant of tealab.)

To restart the tealab stuff:
	kill tealabcontrol
	mobdl -l root killall perl    (Need to be more selective here...)
	./runtealab test4/tealab.tdf  

watcher does not need to be restarted with tealab or tealabcontrol.
