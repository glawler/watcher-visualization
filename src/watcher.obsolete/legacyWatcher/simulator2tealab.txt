First, write a config file, and a locations file with the correct IP addrs
and initial physical locations.

Then, run the simulator:
	./inteirm2 tommy.conf 1000 > foo 2> foo2

The second argument is the time to simulate, in seconds.

Set your mob set:  (must match the locations file)
	mobpickset control tommy
(simulator2tealab uses the mob stuff to figure out what the MAC addrs of the
nodes are, for tealab.)

Then run simulator2tealab
	mkdir tommy
	simulator2telab foo tommy
The second argument is a directory in which to put the config files.  It will
create a tealab.tdf file, and a locations file for each timestamp.

Then, copy your config file into the directory, and use the file
tick1.locations as the locations file in it.

To run it, read tealabcontrol.txt.
