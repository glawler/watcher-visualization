The justneighbors clustering algorithm

The purpose of this clustering algorithm is to determine the node's one hop
neighbors, but other than that to be externally controled.  It understands
the state vector messages generated by the IDSStateSet() idsCommunications
call (see statetest).  It uses the hello module for the actual neighbor
sensing, then uses the state vector code from interim2.
